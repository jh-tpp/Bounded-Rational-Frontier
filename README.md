# The Bounded Rational Frontier

This repository contains the materials for the research note titled *"The Bounded Rational Frontier: Implications for Research in AI, Economics, and Philosophy"*. The note introduces a simple toy model to explore bounded rationality in decision-making, highlighting its implications across various fields.

## Viewing the Note

GitHub’s web interface may not display the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and HTML files correctly. If you're interested in reading the research note, **I recommend viewing the PDF version, which is fully compatible and displays all content as intended**.

You can view the PDF directly [here](./Rational_Frontiers_note.pdf).

## Playing with the Code

If you're interested in experimenting with the code, you're welcome to download the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook locally. The code demonstrates the bounded rationality model and includes visualizations such as frontier curves and uncertainty aversion.

## Project Contents

- `Rational_Frontiers_Note.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the research note, model details, and code.
- `Rational_Frontiers_Note.pdf`: A PDF version of the note for easier reading.
- `Rational_Frontiers_Note.html`: An HTML export of the notebook (not fully compatible with GitHub’s online rendering).
- `Images/`: A folder containing the images used in the notebook.
- `Modules/`: A folder containing the underlying code.
- `Results/`: A folder storing results of some of the model simulations.

### How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jh-tpp/Bounded-Rational-Frontier.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Bounded-Rational-Frontier
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Rational_Frontiers_Note.ipynb
    ```

## Contributions & Collaboration

I invite researchers from AI, economics, philosophy, and other related fields to explore and build on this work. Feel free to fork this repository, open issues, or submit pull requests. For collaboration inquiries or feedback, please reach out via GitHub or contact me directly.
